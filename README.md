# Sobel vs Laplacian Edge Detection

## Overview
This project demonstrates the differences between **Sobel** and **Laplacian** edge detection filters using OpenCV and Matplotlib. It applies both filters to a grayscale image and visualizes the results to understand how each method detects edges.

## Features
- Applies **Sobel filter** in both X and Y directions.
- Computes the **gradient magnitude** from the Sobel filter.
- Applies the **Laplacian filter** for overall edge detection.
- Displays the original and processed images side by side for comparison.

## Comparison
- **Sobel Filter**: Detects edges in a specific direction (horizontal/vertical) and reduces noise.
- **Laplacian Filter**: Detects edges in all directions but is more sensitive to noise.
